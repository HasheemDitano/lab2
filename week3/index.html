<h1>Introduction to Hash's Life </h1> 
<p>My full name is Abdul Hasheem Omega Ditano.</p>
<p style="color:red;">But I like to be called Hash.</p>
<p><b>My favorite quote from Paulo Coelho was:</b> â€œAll battles in life serve to <i>teach</i> us something, even the battles we <i>lose."</i></p>
<p>Another inspiring quote from Paulo Coelho I liked was his: <q>Straight roads do not make skillful drivers.</q></p>
